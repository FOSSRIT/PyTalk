PyTalk
======

A program for Raspberry Pi that allows the capture of audio and transfers it as text to an IRC client. We are currently using a Python Library called Speech Recognition 1.1.0 for the code to interpret the speech itself. You can find the Library here: https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition and here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/
We will also be hosting the finished package over on Pypi
